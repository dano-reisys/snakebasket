Snakebasket
===============

The pip++ which will eventually make python development a little easier:
Features:
 * Follow requirements.txt or requirements-$POSTFIX.txt files in 
   the root of editable requirements during install.
 * In case of conflicting requirements, choose the newer version.

Installation
---
Within your virtualenv, run:
`curl -ss -L http://href.prezi.com/snakebasket | bash -s`

Legacy
---
*Don't use this version unless you want to spend countless hours debugging unreadable code!*
The old and untested version of snakebasket can be installed via pip from:
`pip install -e git+git@github.com:prezi/snakebasket.git@v1.0.0#egg=snakebasket`

Development
---
Because snakebasket includes [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) as a sub-repo, use
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:prezi/snakebasket.git 
```
to clone the repository completely.


To run snakebasket tests, you must first create a virtualenv
and add the necessary testing packages:
```
virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages -p python2.6 sb-venv
. sb-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-development.txt 
```
To run tests, make sure the virtualenv is active, then execute the
following from the project root:
```
cd tests/
python runtests.py
```
Warnings about certificates are expected, pay them no attention:
```
warning: bitbucket.org certificate with fingerprint 24:9c:45:8b:9c:aa:ba:55:4e:01:6d:58:ff:e4:28:7d:2a:14:ae:3b not verified (check hostfingerprints or web.cacerts config setting)
```

### Detailed Description
In the Python world, pip is a popular tool for installing packages and dependencies:

`pip install Django`

or, if you have a list of dependencies:

`pip install -r packages_we_need.txt`

pip works great for basic applications with few dependencies and a flat structure (packages that don't depend on other packages which then  depend on other packages), but when you try and use pip for an application like this:

![dependency hell](https://github.com/prezi/snakebasket/wiki/dependency_hell.jpg)

pip chokes. And that's where snakebasket comes in.

There are two major features of snakebasket that make up for two of pip's shortcomings: 

**1. Installs recursive dependencies.**

    With pip, every desired package needs to be manually `pip installed`.

    snakebasket `sb install`s (via `pip install`) a list of dependencies from the desired package's `requirements.txt` fileâ€”and then it installs further packages form the `requirements.txt` file of every subsequent dependency, recursively.

**2. Decides between conflicting versions of the same package.**

    pip allows exactly one version of a package to be installed in a given environment, and thus expects all packages to depend on that same single version. In this example:

```python
#foo/setup.py
setup(
    name="foo",
    ...
    packages["ReportLab=1.7"]
)
```

```python
#bar/setup.py
setup(
    name="bar",
    ...
    packages["ReportLab=0.9"]
)
```

where foo.py and bar.py are installed in the same environment, pip would break as it only allows one of the versions to exist at a given time, and it has no mechanism to properly decide which to install.

Thus, to use pip by itself is to have to manually keep all versions in sync across an environment. In complex applications with many contributors, this doesn't scale well.

In the above situation, snakebasket installs the latest version, and then it `sb install`s that decision.

It is recommended to specify the requirements in a simple `requirements.txt` from which snakebasket automatically reads:
```
#foo/requirements.txt
ReportLab=1.7
```

```
#bar/requirements.txt
ReportLab=0.9
```

Explicit versions are always recommended. Regardless of where it is in the hierarchy, the latest specified version of any dependency is the one that is ultimately installed. If an explicit version is not specified, snakebasket interprets that to mean the latest available version.

The only situation where the non-latest version could be installed is where one depedency version is implict (not pinned), another (earlier) dependency version is explicit, and the `--prefer-pinned-revision` flag is set during `sb install`

Of course, all of this *makes a huge assumption on the backwards compatibility of dependencies*. snakebasket currently relies on this assumption.
